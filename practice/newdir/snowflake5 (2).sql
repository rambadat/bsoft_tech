Stream
======
A stream is a Snowflake object that tracks row-level changes (insert/update/delete) on a table ‚Äî used for change data capture (CDC).
Snowflake Streams (Change Data Capture / CDC) shine when you want to capture only what has changed in a table since the last time you checked, without reprocessing the entire dataset.
Streams in Snowflake for Change Data Capture (CDC), and your source table (COVID_DATA_ALL) can have INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs, then you should definitely use a MERGE statement instead of plain INSERT.

We can create streams on base table and dump data into second table and also 
create another stream which tracks changes from second table and thus dumps into third table and so on.


üîÅ Snowpipe vs. Snowpipe Streaming vs. Stream
Feature			Stream (CDC)							Snowpipe								Snowpipe Streaming
Type			Metadata object							File-based data ingestion				Real-time API-based ingestion
Trigger			Manual or task							Auto-ingest from stage (via queue)		*Push from app/client via SDK (not Pull)
Data Source		Internal Snowflake table				External file (CSV, JSON)				External app/service ‚Üí Snowflake table
Latency			Micro-batch								Near real-time (minutes)				Real-time (seconds or less)
Best for		Downstream processing					Scheduled or auto file loading			Streaming from APIs, Kafka, or connectors


üîπ Snowflake Stream (CDC) is not about loading data into Snowflake ‚Äî its about tracking changes inside Snowflake after data is loaded.

Stream (CDC): Monitor changes in ORDERS table to replicate into ANALYTICS_ORDERS
Snowpipe: Load .csv files dropped in Azure Blob Storage using COPY INTO
Snowpipe Streaming: Ingest events from Kafka or StreamKap directly to Snowflake in <5 sec

‚úÖ What Developers Use Streams For
Most developers (in ELT scenarios) prefer to use streams + tasks to:
Monitor a staging table
Identify new or changed rows
Apply transformations or merges to target tables


Stream Flow
-----------
Table: SALES_DATA

‚Üì (CREATE STREAM)

Stream: SALES_STREAM tracks INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations

‚Üì (SELECT from stream)

You read changes using: SELECT * FROM SALES_STREAM;

‚Üì (Snowflake automatically marks the stream as "consumed")


üîπ Step 1: Create a Stream on COVID_DATA_ALL
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM STR_COVID_ALL 
ON TABLE COVID_DATA_ALL 
APPEND_ONLY = FALSE; -- important to capture UPDATE/DELETE too


üîπ Step 2: Create a Task to MERGE into COVID_DATA_2021
Assuming you have:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE COVID_DATA_2021 LIKE COVID_DATA_ALL;
Now, your task would look like this:

CREATE OR REPLACE TASK TASK_MERGE_2021
  WAREHOUSE = my_wh
  SCHEDULE = '5 MINUTE'
AS
MERGE INTO COVID_DATA_2021 AS TARGET
USING (
    SELECT *
    FROM STR_COVID_ALL
    WHERE YEAR = 2021
) AS SOURCE
ON TARGET.COUNTRY = SOURCE.COUNTRY 
   AND TARGET.STATE = SOURCE.STATE
   AND TARGET.YEAR = SOURCE.YEAR  -- add more keys as needed
WHEN MATCHED AND METADATA$ACTION = 'DELETE' THEN DELETE
WHEN MATCHED AND METADATA$ACTION = 'UPDATE' THEN 
    UPDATE SET
      TARGET.CASES = SOURCE.CASES,
      TARGET.DEATHS = SOURCE.DEATHS
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (COUNTRY, STATE, YEAR, CASES, DEATHS)
    VALUES (SOURCE.COUNTRY, SOURCE.STATE, SOURCE.YEAR, SOURCE.CASES, SOURCE.DEATHS);
	
Banking Example
---------------	
A bank has a transactions table where millions of records come in daily from multiple payment systems.
Downstream, Finance needs a reconciliation fact table (fact_transactions) for reporting.
Instead of reloading the whole source table every time (expensive + slow), they just want incremental inserts/updates/deletes.

üîπ Without Stream
You‚Äôd need to manually figure out deltas using timestamps or surrogate keys.
Risk of missing late-arriving data or double-counting.
Inefficient ‚Äî scanning a huge table again and again.

üîπ With Stream
Create a stream on the source table:
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM transactions_stream ON TABLE transactions;
Stream automatically tracks all DML changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) since last consumption.
Your ETL / ELT process just reads from the stream:

INSERT INTO fact_transactions
SELECT * 
FROM transactions_stream;

Once consumed, those changes are marked as read ‚Äî so next run only gets new changes.

‚úÖ Benefits
Efficiency ‚Üí Only changed rows processed.
Accuracy ‚Üí Captures deletes/updates correctly, unlike timestamp-based methods.
Real-time ELT ‚Üí Combine with Tasks to build automated pipelines (micro-batches or near real-time).
Auditing ‚Üí You can even keep a history of changes (before vs after values).

üîπ Concrete Example
Suppose yesterday you had:
txn_id | amount | status
---------------------------------
101    | 500    | SUCCESS
102    | 200    | SUCCESS
103    | 300    | PENDING

Today, the source system does:
Insert a new row (txn 104).
Update txn 103 ‚Üí SUCCESS.
Delete txn 102.

Your Stream on transactions will capture exactly these 3 changes:
txn_id | amount | status   | metadata$action
------------------------------------------------
104    | 150    | SUCCESS  | INSERT
103    | 300    | SUCCESS  | UPDATE
102    | 200    | SUCCESS  | DELETE

Your pipeline applies them to the fact table ‚Äî clean, efficient, correct.

üëâ This is why many financial services, retail, and e-commerce companies use Snowflake Streams for CDC to keep downstream marts, reconciliation systems, or audit stores in sync without reloading massive datasets.

can we take base table of oracle or some other database and create stream in snowflake
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Directly creating a stream on Oracle (or any external DB) ‚Üí Not possible
A Snowflake Stream can only be created on a Snowflake table.
It cannot track changes in Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres, etc. directly.

‚úÖ How to handle Oracle (or other DB) CDC in Snowflake
If you want CDC from Oracle into Snowflake, the typical flow is:
Capture changes in Oracle
  -Use Oracle GoldenGate, Debezium, StreamSets, Fivetran, HVR, or similar CDC tools.
  -These capture inserts/updates/deletes from Oracle redo/transaction logs.
Land data into Snowflake staging tables
  -Usually via Snowpipe, external stages (S3, Azure Blob, GCS), or direct connectors.
Create a Snowflake Stream on those Snowflake staging tables
  -CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM oracle_txn_stream ON TABLE oracle_txn_stage;

Now Snowflake can track changes after landing in Snowflake.

üîπ Example Flow

Snowpipe Streaming
==================
Snowpipe Streaming is all about letting a source application (or CDC connector) push data directly into a Snowflake table through an API, instead of dropping files into cloud storage first.

üìå Use Case of Snowpipe Streaming
Scenario
Imagine a fintech payment app that processes real-time transactions. Each transaction (swipe, UPI payment, or transfer) generates a JSON event:
{
  "txn_id": "TXN12345",
  "amount": 250.75,
  "currency": "INR",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-25T14:32:45Z"
}

The business wants:
Real-time dashboards in Tableau/Power BI.
Fraud detection with minimal lag (< few seconds).
No waiting for files to batch-load.

üîπ How Snowpipe Streaming Helps
The payment application (or Kafka/Flink connector) calls the Snowpipe Streaming API.
Data is pushed row-by-row (or micro-batches) directly into a Snowflake ingestion buffer.
Within a few seconds, data is visible in the Snowflake target table.
Analysts (or fraud detection systems) query the data with near real-time freshness.

‚úÖ Advantages vs Traditional Snowpipe
*No file staging ‚Üí No S3/Azure/GCS required.  [Very Important]
Low latency ‚Üí Data is queryable almost instantly.
Ideal for streaming events ‚Üí IoT devices, payments, clickstream, sensor logs, CDC feeds.

üîπ Example Flow Diagram
Source App / Kafka / GoldenGate Microservice ‚Üí Snowpipe Streaming API ‚Üí Snowflake Table ‚Üí Stream/Task ‚Üí Downstream Fact Table / Dashboard

1. Create Table in snowflake
   CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE PAYMENT_EVENTS (
	 txn_id STRING,
	 amount NUMBER(10,2),
	 currency STRING,
	 status STRING,
	 timestamp TIMESTAMP
	);

2. Set up Snowflake Connector for Snowpipe Streaming
   pip install snowflake-snowpark-python
   pip install snowflake-connector-python
   pip install snowflake-ingest
   
3. Python code
	import time
	import random
	import uuid
	from snowflake.snowpark import Session
	from snowflake.ingest import SimpleIngestManager, StagedFile

	# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowflake connection parameters
	connection_parameters = {
		"account": "<your_account>.snowflakecomputing.com",
		"user": "<your_user>",
		"password": "<your_password>",
		"role": "SYSADMIN",
		"warehouse": "COMPUTE_WH",
		"database": "STREAMING_DB",
		"schema": "PUBLIC"
	}

	# Create a Snowpark session
	session = Session.builder.configs(connection_parameters).create()

	# Target table (must exist beforehand)
	target_table = "PAYMENT_EVENTS"

	# Create a writer for Snowpipe Streaming
	writer = session.table(target_table).streaming_ingest()

	# Function to generate fake payment event
	def generate_event():
		return {
			"txn_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
			"amount": round(random.uniform(10, 5000), 2),
			"currency": "INR",
			"status": random.choice(["SUCCESS", "FAILED", "PENDING"]),
			"timestamp": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
		}

	# Continuously stream events
	print("üöÄ Streaming events into Snowflake... Press Ctrl+C to stop")
	try:
		while True:
			event = generate_event()
			writer.write_pandas(session.create_dataframe([event]))
			print(f"Inserted event: {event}")
			time.sleep(2)  # every 2 seconds
	except KeyboardInterrupt:
		print("Stopping stream...")
		writer.close()


4. Real-Time Querying
   SELECT * FROM PAYMENT_EVENTS ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;
   Since ingestion is near real-time, you can run above command and see events appear as they are streamed in.
   
Source applications (like payment systems, IoT, Kafka connectors) can push data row by row using the Snowpipe Streaming API.
It avoids staging files and gives low-latency ingestion.   

Oracle Golden Gate (CDC Tool)
=============================
1. Can we take base table of oracle or some other database and create stream in snowflake ?

‚ùå Directly creating a stream on Oracle (or any external DB) ‚Üí Not possible
A Snowflake Stream can only be created on a Snowflake table.
It cannot track changes in Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres, etc. directly.

  -Oracle Table ‚Üí GoldenGate (CDC) ‚Üí Azure Blob ‚Üí Snowpipe ‚Üí Snowflake Table ‚Üí Snowflake Stream ‚Üí Downstream processing

2. Can oracle golden gate load data directly from oracle table to Azure Blob as csv file : Yes
   GoldenGate can capture changes from Oracle redo/transaction logs.
   It can then use the GoldenGate Big Data Adapter (or GoldenGate for Big Data / Microservices edition) to write CDC events to Azure Blob Storage in various formats Delimited text (CSV) / JSON / Avro / Parquet
   Once the files are in Azure Blob, you can use Snowpipe or COPY INTO to load them into Snowflake.
   
   Flow: Oracle ‚Üí GoldenGate Extract ‚Üí Azure Blob (CSV files) ‚Üí Snowpipe ‚Üí Snowflake table

3. Can oracle golden gate load data directly from oracle table to Snowflake table : Yes with Snowpipe Streaming API
   GoldenGate itself doesn‚Äôt natively talk to Snowflake, but GoldenGate for Big Data (or Microservices) has a Snowflake handler.
   This connector uses Snowflake JDBC driver or Snowpipe Streaming API to push changes directly into Snowflake tables.
   Supported formats: JSON, Avro, Parquet (depending on handler).
